# Build/Run Instructions

## Building and running MySQL Database
1. Inside the application folder, locate the confi folder
2. Inside the confi folder, locate the file titled: postItDB.sql
3. In MySQL workbench, open up local host server and open the file postItDB.sql inside of local host server.
4. Execute the query for postItDB.sql and the server should be made.

Sidenote: I was unable to export the database as shown in the video due to MySQL workbench errors. I was only able to forward engineer the database for the project which still contains the code to create the database. Please let me know if there's any questions or concerns.
